# Scan

A simple project to turn my Raspberry Print Server into a scan server.
It sends the scanned image to pre-configured mail adresses on a single button press.

The buttons are used to trigger a falling edge which triggers a python event handler.

The daemon lifecycle is managed with Supervisord
